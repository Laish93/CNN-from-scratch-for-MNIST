# CNN-from-scratch-for-MNIST

In this notebook, Convolutional Neural Network was built by just using Numpy including both forward and backpropagation algorithms. Additionally, the results were well validated by the TensorFlow implementation with the same parameters. The following layers were coded in order to achieve the CNN. 

  * Convolutional layer
  * ReLU
  * Max Pooling
  * Fully connected layer
  * Softmax
