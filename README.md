# CNN-from-scratch-for-MNIST

In this notebook, I have built a Convolutional Neural Network just using Numpy. Additionally, the results were well validated by the TensorFlow implementation with the same parameters.

  * Convolutional layer
  * ReLU
  * Max Pooling
  * Fully connected layer
  * Softmax
  * Cross entropy error
